# auvsi-cv-motionEstimation
Learn how we perceive motion and how to estimate motion using a technique called Optical Flow. You can use three algorithms to implement optical flow using the Computer Vision Toolbox. These three algorithms are Horn-Schunck method, Farneback method, and Lucas-Kanade method. An example of a robot boat moving through a field of buoys will be used.
